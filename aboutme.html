        My whole philospy behind starting up at Lambda School was, I needed to
        make a change. I wanted to take hold of my own future and work towards a
        tangible goal, to me that future involved technology. I want to get into
        social media and make a difference. I feel like a lot of people in my
        generation use social media as a way to compare themselves to the next
        person that looks like their life is "made". I truly want to work
        towards a more community oriented social media experience. Lambda seems
        like the stepping stone I needed to make those dreams become reality.
        Hopefully through lots of hard work and dedication I can make that come
        true, I also hope there are people out there that feel the same way and
        could help me in my journey. If i had to write from my future selfs
        perspective, I would say. My life has changed for the best, rather than√ü
        waiting around for life to happen you went out and did it. This website
        is proof enough that you can make strides on your own to create
        something even with no instruction. You will make more amazing things
        over the next 6 months, some projects will seem easy others will be much
        more difficult. those more challenging ones will allow you to grow not
        only as a person but as a software developer. Dont lose hope because the
        road to the top seems too steep, these things will temper your spirit.
        Keep going and remember you always have people that will want to help
        you.
